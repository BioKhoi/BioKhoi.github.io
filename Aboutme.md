## About me, microbiome and my vision

- I am an interdisciplinary [microbiome](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/microbiome/) [data scientist](https://hbr.org/2018/08/what-data-scientists-really-do-according-to-35-data-scientists) with 3 years of experience in statistical analyses, bioinformatics and nutrition. Studying gut microbiome slowly changes my habitual selection of food toward a healthier diet as another method to stay in shape besides [ballroom dancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballroom_dance). 

- My ultimate goal is to become a microbiome data scientist, lecturer and independent research scientist applying problem solving methods to fight chronic diseases and improve the population health. Breaking the goal into milestones, I first obtained different skills from extracting bacterial DNA to programming through many microbiome projects focusing on diet-microbiome-host inter-relationship.

- Transitioning to industry is one further step to expand my network and my interdisciplinary collaborations to get a bigger picture of how the microbiome market is emerging. As the same time, I taught myself machine learning methods to predict [individualised response in human intervention](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-021-00499-1). 

- Bridging discipline and variety of sectors shed light on my career path. Therefore,  I determined to further explore the gut microbiome in many aspects such as [mycobiome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01820-z), viral community and [bacteriophage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312819300575) in both human and [gnotobiotic mice](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1206025) using different advantaged tools in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Finally, I hope to fill in the scientific gaps and set the framework for microbiome implication in [precision medicine](https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/about/precision_med.htm).
