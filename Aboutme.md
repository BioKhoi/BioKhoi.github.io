## About me, microbiome and my vision

- I am an interdisciplinary [microbiome](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/microbiome/) [data scientist](https://hbr.org/2018/08/what-data-scientists-really-do-according-to-35-data-scientists) with 3 years of experience in statistical analyses, bioinformatics and nutrition. Studying gut microbiome slowly changes my habitual selection of food toward a healthier diet as another method to stay in shape besides [ballroom dancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballroom_dance). 

- My ultimate goal is to become a microbiome data scientist, lecturer and independent research scientist applying problem solving methods to fight chronic diseases and improve the population health. Breaking the goal into milestones, I first obtained different skills from extracting bacterial DNA to programming through many microbiome projects focusing on diet-microbiome-host inter-relationship.

- Transitioning to industry is one further step to expand my network and my interdisciplinary collaborations to get a bigger picture of how the microbiome market is emerging. As the same time, I taught myself machine learning methods to predict [individualised response in human intervention](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-021-00499-1). 

- Bridging discipline and variety of sectors shed light on my career path. Therefore,  I determined to further explore the gut microbiome in many aspects such as [mycobiome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01820-z), viral community and [bacteriophage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312819300575) in both human and [gnotobiotic mice](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1206025) using different advantaged tools in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Finally, I hope to fill in the scientific gaps and set the framework for microbiome implication in [precision medicine](https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/about/precision_med.htm). 


## I am from Vietnam


### Ballroom dancing why not?

will be avaiable soon!

### Have you ever grown a medicinal Reshi mushroom ?

will be avaiable soon!

### I can turn [clay into flowers](/pdf/Khoi_clay_flower.pdf)



From 2013 to 2015, I and my partner opened a small business in art & handmade sector. We both love flowers but they are too expensive and will not stay fresh long. Therefore, we decided to make a kind of flower that can stay for long and look like the real one. 
It was a long journey with full of memories, we tried all kinds of possible materials such as paper, platic, or cloth and unfortunately none of them satisfied ourselves.

Until one day we mixed a kind of natural polymer clay with oil colour and it seems to be a perfect combination to mimic the actual texture as well as colour of a rose petal. I know we were on the right tracks. Then, we kept exploring, experimenting, taking classes, learning from our own mistakes. Several months later, we can be able to make a first clay flower. It was a Rose. 

We had our name combined to make nguyenphuong logo and sold our products under that brand. However, We could not continue when I decide to go study abroad.
