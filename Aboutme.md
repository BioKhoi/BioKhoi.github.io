## About me, microbiome and my vision

- I am an interdisciplinary [microbiome](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/microbiome/) [data scientist](https://hbr.org/2018/08/what-data-scientists-really-do-according-to-35-data-scientists) since 2020 with years of experience in microbiology, statistical analyses, bioinformatics and nutrition. Studying gut microbiome slowly changes my habitual selection of food toward a healthier diet as another method to stay in shape besides [ballroom dancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballroom_dance). 

- My ultimate goal is to become a microbiome data scientist, a lecturer and an independent research scientist applying problem solving methods to fight chronic diseases and improve the population health. Dividing the goal into milestones, I first obtained different skills from wet lab to dry lab through many microbiome projects focusing on diet-microbiome-host inter-relationship.

- Transitioning to industry is one further step to expand my network and my interdisciplinary collaborations to vision a bigger picture of the emerging microbiome market. As the same time, I taught myself machine learning methods and other advanceds bioinformatic tools to explore the 'omic' complex data.

- Bridging discipline and variety of sectors shed light on my career path. Therefore,  I determined to further explore the gut microbiome in many aspects such as [mycobiome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01820-z), viral community and [bacteriophage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312819300575) in both human and [gnotobiotic mice](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1206025) using different advantaged tools in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Finally, I hope to fill in the scientific gaps and set the framework for microbiome implication in [precision medicine](https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/about/precision_med.htm).

## My Non-Academic Background


### 1. Ballroom dancing why not?

will be available soon!

### 2. Have you ever grown a medicinal Reshi mushroom?

will be available soon!

### 3. I can turn [clay into flowers](/pdf/Clay_album.pdf)



From 2013 to 2015, I and my partner opened a small business in art & handmade sector. We both love flowers, but they are too expensive and will not stay fresh long. Therefore, we decided to make a kind of flower that can stay for long and look like the real one. 
It was a long journey with full of memories, we tried all kinds of possible materials such as paper, plastic, or cloth and unfortunately none of them satisfied ourselves.

Until one day we mixed a kind of natural polymer clay with oil colour and it seems to be a perfect combination to mimic the actual texture as well as colour of a Moth orchid (Phalaenopsis). I know we were on the right tracks. Then, we kept exploring, experimenting, taking classes, learning from our own mistakes. Several months later, we could be able to make a complete orchid clay flower.

We had our name combined to make nguyenphuong logo and sold our products under that brand (you can check out the our best collection [here](/pdf/Clay_album.pdf) ).We, howver,  had to close the shop when I had decided to go study abroad.
