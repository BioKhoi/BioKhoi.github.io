## ACADEMIC RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

---
#### Microbiome Data Scietist | Microbiome Insights Inc | Vancouver, BC, Canada |2020 - present

Analysed microbiome data obtained from **fecal, skin, oral, saliva, insect & soil** samples from more than **99 projects** 
#### Selected projects:
1. Study the effect of **Ivermectin on gut microbiota** using animal model - **_Peggy L Kandell, MD_, Washinton University in St Loouis.**
   -  Leaded and performed microbiome data (16Sv4) analysis (community examination, identifying differential abundant taxa)
   -  Applied unsupervised clustering technique to distingush main traits by microbiome features
   -  Identified co-abundance group (CAG: [method](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40168-020-00887-w;)) of bacteria and assessed their inter and intra [association network](https://cytoscape.org/) to evaluate the impact of Ivermectin on bacterial ecology

2. Comparing **biofilms**, which were obtained from **dental plaque**, grown on different materials - **_Thomas M. Johnson DMD, MS | COL, DC_, USARMY DENCOM ATLANTIC (USA) & _Joseph Retrum, DMD, MAJ, DC_, US Army Advanced Education in Periodontics, Tingay Dental Clinic**
   - Processed raw amplicon sequecing data (16Sv3v4) to generate amplicon sequencing variant (ASV) table 
   - Performed [Linear mixed model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/vignettes/lmer.pdf) to evaluate richness and eveness of longitudinal data
   - Performed Adonis test and pairwise comparisons to assess beta-diversity of bacterial communities
   - Identified abundant taxa which are significantly different to test hypotheses using [DEseq2](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8) method 
 3. Identifying possible **pathogenic** bacteria inside  Asian longhorned **ticks** - **_LTC Sillas Davidson,Msc, PhD_, United State Military Academy WEST POINT**
      - Excuted automate pipeline to visualise proportion of different types of bacteria in each sample at different taxonomic levels (Phylum - genus) in a [stacked bar plot](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/stacked-barplot.html) using [Phyloseq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/) package in R. 
      - Computed different diversity indices to compare microbiome across groups by ANOVA
      - Performed literature search to avoid false positive resutls
      - Interpreted the results and explained the analysis and discussed the future direction with the client
4. Study the effect of wearing a **N95 mask** on **skin microbiome** - **_Grey Hillerband, PhD_, Ammway**
   - Processed raw amplicon sequecing data (16Sv1v3) to generate OTU table 
   - Examined longitudinal data of skin microbiome and performed univariate & multivariate analysis
   - Visualised and interpret the resutls
5. Study the effect of aggregate mining disturbance on **soil microbiome** - **_Akshit Puri, PhD_, University College Dublin**
   - Processed raw amplicon sequecing data (16Sv4 & ITS2)
   - Illustrated microbiome and mycobiom communities using [Krona chart](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-12-385)
   - Converting microbiome data using [Phylogenetic Isometric Log-Ratio Transform (Philr)](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/philr.html) before applying [environmental fitting vector](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/vegan/versions/2.4-2/topics/envfit) to determin the association bettween microorganism and soil parameters on [principal component analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4346)




Supported the multidisciplinary team in data analysis and bioinformatic by consulting, developing statistical analysis plans, 
performing advanced analyses, visualizing data, developing code for particular statistical tasks, gathering and depositing genomic data, 
 identifying taxonomy and gene functions 
Contributed to grant application by preparing SOP, manuals of gut microbiome analysis from human sample collection to data analysis. 
Assisted the PI by explaining the statistical approaches, providing slides for conference and meeting with companies, 
conducting literature review and training a visiting scholar in a collaborative project.
