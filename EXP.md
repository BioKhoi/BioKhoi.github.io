   - Performed [Linear mixed model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/vignettes/lmer.pdf) to evaluate richness and eveness of longitudinal data
   - Performed Adonis test and pairwise comparisons to assess beta-diversity of bacterial communities
   - Identified abundant taxa which are significantly different to test hypotheses using [DEseq2](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8) method 
 3. Identifying possible **pathogenic** bacteria inside  Asian longhorned **ticks** - **_LTC Sillas Davidson,Msc, PhD_, United State Military Academy WEST POINT**
      - Excuted automate pipeline to visualise proportion of different types of bacteria in each sample at different taxonomic levels (Phylum - genus) in a [stacked bar plot](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/stacked-barplot.html) using [Phyloseq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/) package in R. 
      - Computed different diversity indices to compare microbiome across groups by ANOVA
      - Performed literature search to avoid false positive resutls
      - Interpreted the results and explained the analysis and discussed the future direction with the client
4. Study the effect of wearing a **N95 mask** on **skin microbiome** - **_Grey Hillerband, PhD_, Ammway**
   - Processed raw amplicon sequecing data (16Sv1v3) to generate OTU table 
   - Examined longitudinal data of skin microbiome and performed univariate & multivariate analysis
   - Visualised and interpret the resutls
5. Study the effect of aggregate mining disturbance on **soil microbiome** - **_Akshit Puri, PhD_, University College Dublin**
   - Processed raw amplicon sequecing data (16Sv4 & ITS2)
   - Illustrated microbiome and mycobiom communities using [Krona chart](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-12-385)
   - Converting microbiome data using [Phylogenetic Isometric Log-Ratio Transform (Philr)](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/philr.html) before applying [environmental fitting vector](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/vegan/versions/2.4-2/topics/envfit) to determin the association bettween microorganism and soil parameters on [principal component analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4346)


#### Voluntary Project 

+ [Efficacy of Lifestyle Intervention in BRCA1/2 Mutation Carriers (LIBRE-2)](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02516540) - _**Prof. Stephan C Bischoff, MD**_, **Univeristy of Hohenheim** 
    - Leaded the data analysis part to study the impact of Mediterranean diet on gut barrier function of women with high risk of breast cancer
    - Performed [Mediation analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mediation/vignettes/mediation.pdf) to identify the possible mechanisms between Diet, SCFA and gut barrier function
    - Identified different partterns of the response within the same treatment to raise the question regarding indidualised responses by [clustering subjects](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/factoextra/versions/1.0.7/topics/fviz_dend) on [cirle heatmap](https://jokergoo.github.io/circlize_book/book/circos-heatmap.html)
    - Visualised multi-dimensional data in [complex heatmap](https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference/book/) 
    - Performed Machine learning (Random Forest Classification - [Caret package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/vignettes/caret.html); [ROC curve](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ROSE/ROSE.pdf) ) to test if baseline characteristics can determine the individual response to Mediterranean diet
    - Introduced the study, design, method and results by generating infographic figure
    - Generated the [discussion figure](https://biorender.com/) which highlights the implication of machine learning in predicting the response and raised the questions on the possible underline mechanisms of how diet can impact the gut integrity. 
    - Participated in writing the manuscript
